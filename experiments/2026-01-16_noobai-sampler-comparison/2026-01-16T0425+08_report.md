# 📄 Report: NoobAI XL Workflow Optimization & Sampler Analysis
**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Model:** NoobAI XL
**Objective:** To determine the optimal Sampler/Scheduler combination and validate the impact of disabling the "Reconstructive" Hand Detailer.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Two controlled experiments were conducted to compare "Complex" (Full Detailer) vs. "Simplified" (Face Only) workflows.

* **Top Finding:** Disabling the Hand Detailer (MeshGraphormer/ControlNet) **increased the overall success rate by +5%** (from 23% to 28%).
* **Best Sampler:** **Euler Ancestral (Euler A)** is statistically superior, achieving a **~33% success rate** compared to **~18%** for standard Euler.
* **Best Scheduler:** Once the invasive Hand Detailer was removed, the performance gap between `sgm_uniform` and `simple` vanished. Both are now viable.

---

## 2. Experiment 1: The "Complex" Workflow
**Configuration:**
* **Detailers:** **ON** (Face + Hand w/ MeshGraphormer & ControlNet).
* **Face Settings:** Crop Factor 3.0 (Too high), Euler A, High CFG.
* **Hand Settings:** "Reconstruction" Mode (High Denoise, Graphormer).

### Results (Total Liked: 23)
| Group Combination | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Euler A + sgm_uniform** <br> **& Euler + simple** | **15 Liked** | The "Golden Pair" of the first test. Balanced noise with strict scheduling. |
| **B: Euler A + simple** <br> **& Euler + sgm_uniform** | **8 Liked** | **Failed.** "Euler A + Simple" caused "Thin Sliver" crashes and geometry errors due to "Double Chaos." |

### ⚠️ Issues Identified
* **Destructive Editing:** The Hand Detailer frequently overwrote "Good Hands" with distorted skeletons.
* **Artifacts:** Visible dark rectangles ("Ghost Boxes") appeared due to VAE color shifting/contrast burn.
* **Instability:** "Long Sliver" bug caused ComfyUI crashes.

---

## 3. Experiment 2: The "Simplified" Workflow
**Configuration:**
* **Detailers:** **Face Only** (Hand Detailer **DISABLED**).
* **Face Settings Optimized:** Crop Factor 2.0, Sampler `Euler`, CFG 4.0, Steps 16.
* **Sample Size:** 100 Images (50 per run).
* **Sampler Ratio:** Euler A : Euler = 2 : 1.

### Results (Total Liked: 28)
| Group Combination | Result | Breakdown |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Group 1:** <br> Euler A + simple <br> Euler + sgm_uniform | **14 Liked** | **12** from Euler A<br>**2** from Euler |
| **Group 2:** <br> Euler A + sgm_uniform <br> Euler + simple | **14 Liked** | **10** from Euler A<br>**4** from Euler |

### ✅ Improvements Observed
* **No Crashes:** Workflow is stable.
* **No "Dark Boxes":** Removing the Hand Detailer eliminated the VAE color shift on hands.
* **Equal Scheduler Performance:** Unlike Exp 1, `simple` and `sgm_uniform` performed equally well once the unstable Hand Detailer was removed.

## 4. Deep Dive Analysis

### A. Sampler Performance (Euler A vs. Euler)
Aggregating the data from Experiment 2 reveals a decisive winner.

| Sampler | Approx. Pool Size | Total Liked | **Success Rate** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Euler Ancestral (Euler A)** | ~67 images | **22** | **32.8%** |
| **Euler (Standard)** | ~33 images | **6** | **18.2%** |

* **Analysis:** Euler A is nearly **2x more successful** for this specific model/prompt. Its ability to add noise allows it to "wiggle" out of bad geometry valleys, whereas standard Euler often gets stuck generating stiff or broken limbs.

### B. Workflow Impact (Before vs. After)
| Metric | Exp 1 (With Hand Detailer) | Exp 2 (Face Only) | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Liked Rate** | 23% | **28%** | **+5% (Absolute)** |
| **Critical Failures** | High (Crashes, Bad Hands) | **Zero** | **Stable** |

* **Analysis:** The "Repair" node was actually a "Damage" node. Disabling it saved 5% of the images that were previously being ruined by aggressive overwriting.

## 5. Final Recommendations ("The Golden Settings")

Based on this data, the Master Workflow should be locked to the following specification:

### 1. Main Generation
* **Sampler:** **`euler_ancestral`** (Required for 33% hit rate).
* **Scheduler:** **`simple`** (Preferred for softer contrast) OR `sgm_uniform` (Viable).
* **Strategy:** Do not mix `Euler` (standard) into production runs; it lowers the yield.

### 2. Refinement Strategy
* **Hand Refinement:** **OFF** in Master Workflow.
    * *Reason:* Euler A generates good hands natively. "Fixing" them causes more harm than good (artifacts).
    * *Protocol:* Only use "Fix Hands Workflow" (MeshGraphormer) manually for specific failed seeds.
* **Face Refinement:** **ON**.
    * **Settings:** Sampler `Euler` (Clean), CFG `4.0` (Safe), Steps `16-20`, Crop Factor `2.0`.
    * *Reason:* High sharpness, no color burn.

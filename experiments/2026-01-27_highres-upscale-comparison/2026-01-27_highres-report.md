# 📄 Report: Highres Upscale Strategy & Detailer Impact Analysis
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Workflow:** `noobai_highres_v1`
**Objective:** Compare "Pure Latent" vs. "Tiled (USDU)" upscaling methods and evaluate the efficacy of Face/Hand detailers in high-resolution pipelines.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
A comparative analysis was conducted using a 31-image dataset to validate the new Highres workflow strategies.

*   **Winner:** **Method 1 (Pure Latent Upscale)** demonstrated superior stability, accounting for **90% (28/31)** of the final retained images.
*   **Failed Challenger:** **Method 2 (USDU)** produced superior texture detail but suffered catastrophic **color banding artifacts**, resulting in a ~10% retention rate.
*   **Detailer Impact:** Counter-intuitively, enabling Face/Hand detailers **degraded quality** in the majority of cases. The high-quality texture generated by the upscaler was often "smoothed out" or destroyed by the detailers.

## 2. Experiment 1: Upscale Method Comparison
**Sample Size:** 31 Source Images (Total 62 generations).

### Configurations
| Feature | Method 1: Pure Latent | Method 2: USDU (Tiled) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upscale Model** | `nearest-exact` (3x) | `lanczos` (3x) |
| **Sampler** | `euler` / 20 steps | `euler_ancestral` / 16 steps |
| **Denoise** | **0.7** | **0.7** |
| **Specifics** | CFG 5.0 | Tile Padding: 32, Blur: 32, Mode: Chess |

### Results (Total Kept: 31)
| Method | Images Kept | Retention Rate | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Method 1 (Pure)** | **28** | **90.3%** | Consistent, clean results. |
| **Method 2 (USDU)** | **3** | **9.7%** | Excellent local detail, but rejected due to artifacts. |

### ⚠️ Analysis: The Banding Issue
Method 2 (USDU) theoretically produced sharper, more "high-definition" textures. However, the **0.7 Denoise** setting was too aggressive for tiled processing, leading to:
*   **Color Banding:** Distinct luminance/saturation shifts between tiles.
*   **Drift:** Some tiles hallucinated slightly different lighting conditions.
*   **Artifacts:** The low tile padding (32px) likely contributed to edge discontinuities.

**Recommendation:** For future USDU attempts, **lower Denoise to 0.4 - 0.5** to preserve global coherence while adding local detail.

---

## 3. Experiment 2: The Detailer Paradox
**Configuration:**
*   **Hand Detailer:** Denoise 0.3.
*   **Face Detailer:** Denoise 0.1.

### Findings
*   **Negative Impact:** In the majority of runs, enabling detailers made the image *worse*.
*   **Texture Destruction:** The primary issue is that the upscaler (Method 1 or 2) generates intricate high-res skin/fabric textures. The Detailer (running on a localized crop) tends to generate a "smooth" VAE-decoded patch that clashes with the surrounding high-frequency noise/grain.
*   **Hand Detailer:** At 0.3 denoise, it consistently degraded hand geometry or texture match.
*   **Face Detailer:** Only useful for correcting "rigid" expression errors (mouth/eyes).

### Statistics (Kept Images)
*   **Without Detailer:** 21 images (67%)
*   **With Face Detailer:** 10 images (33%) - *Used strictly for expression softening.*

---

## 4. Final Recommendations

### 1. Default Strategy
*   **Primary:** Use **Method 1 (Pure Latent)** for production. It is reliable and artifact-free.
*   **Secondary:** Use Method 2 only if Method 1 is too soft, but **reduce Denoise to 0.5**.

### 2. Detailer Protocol
*   **Default State:** **OFF**.
*   **Usage Rule:** Only enable the Face Detailer (Denoise ~0.1) if the raw upscale results in broken eyes or rigid expressions. Do not use it for "enhancement," only for "repair."
*   **Hand Detailer:** **Keep Disabled** for this workflow.

### 3. Workflow Updates
The public template `@workflows/templates/noobai_highres_v1_template.json` should be considered the standard. Users should be advised to toggle off the "Detailer Group" unless specifically needed.

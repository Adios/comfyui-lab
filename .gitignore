# --- Assets ---
# We generally WANT to track .png files (workflow thumbnails)
# But if you have a specific dump folder for generations, list it here:
# generations/
# *.log

# Keep empty folders (git doesn't track them by default, but we might want .gitkeep later)

# --- Private Assets (The Stowaway Repo) ---
# We ignore this entire folder so the main repo never sees it.
